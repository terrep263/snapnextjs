# Deployment Guide for SnapWorxx Next.js

## Prerequisites

Before deploying, make sure you have:

1. âœ… Vercel account (free tier works)
2. âœ… GitHub repository with your code
3. âœ… Supabase project set up with:
   - Database tables created
   - Edge Functions deployed
   - Environment variables noted
4. âœ… Stripe account with publishable key

## Quick Deployment Steps

### 1. Prepare Your Environment Variables

You'll need these environment variables for Vercel:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key-here
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_...
```

### 2. Deploy to Vercel

#### Option A: Using Vercel Dashboard (Recommended)

1. Go to [vercel.com/new](https://vercel.com/new)
2. Import your GitHub repository
3. Select "Next.js" as the framework (should auto-detect)
4. Add environment variables in the deployment configuration
5. Click "Deploy"

#### Option B: Using Vercel CLI

```bash
# Install Vercel CLI globally
npm install -g vercel

# Login to Vercel
vercel login

# Deploy from project directory
cd /path/to/snapworxx-nextjs
vercel

# Follow the prompts to:
# - Link to existing project or create new
# - Set up environment variables
# - Deploy

# For production deployment
vercel --prod
```

#### Option C: Using the Vercel MCP Tool (If Available)

If you have the Vercel MCP tool configured, you can deploy directly from your development environment.

### 3. Configure Environment Variables in Vercel

After deployment:

1. Go to your project dashboard on Vercel
2. Click "Settings" â†’ "Environment Variables"
3. Add each variable:
   - Variable name: `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`
   - Value: Your Supabase URL
   - Environments: Production, Preview, Development
4. Repeat for all variables
5. Redeploy if needed

### 4. Update Supabase Allowed URLs

In your Supabase project:

1. Go to Authentication â†’ URL Configuration
2. Add your Vercel domain to "Site URL"
3. Add to "Redirect URLs":
   - `https://your-app.vercel.app/success`
   - `https://your-domain.com/success` (if using custom domain)

### 5. Update Stripe Redirect URLs

In your Stripe Dashboard:

1. Go to your product settings
2. Update success/cancel URLs to point to your Vercel deployment:
   - Success URL: `https://your-app.vercel.app/success?session_id={CHECKOUT_SESSION_ID}`
   - Cancel URL: `https://your-app.vercel.app/create`

## Post-Deployment Checklist

- [ ] Test home page loads correctly
- [ ] Test create event page with package selection
- [ ] Test Stripe checkout flow (use test mode)
- [ ] Verify success page redirects work
- [ ] Check that all images load properly
- [ ] Test on mobile devices
- [ ] Verify environment variables are set
- [ ] Check Vercel logs for any errors

## Custom Domain Setup (Optional)

1. Go to Project Settings â†’ Domains in Vercel
2. Add your custom domain
3. Configure DNS records as shown
4. Wait for SSL certificate (automatic)
5. Update Supabase and Stripe URLs to use custom domain

## Monitoring

### Vercel Analytics

- Automatically enabled for all deployments
- View in Project â†’ Analytics tab

### Error Tracking

Check deployment logs:
```bash
vercel logs [deployment-url]
```

Or view in Vercel dashboard â†’ Deployments â†’ [deployment] â†’ Logs

## Troubleshooting

### Build Fails

1. Check build logs in Vercel dashboard
2. Common issues:
   - TypeScript errors: Fix in your code
   - Missing dependencies: Run `npm install` locally first
   - Environment variables: Ensure all required vars are set

### Runtime Errors

1. Check Function logs in Vercel
2. Verify environment variables are set correctly
3. Test API endpoints manually
4. Check Supabase connection

### Images Not Loading

1. Verify image paths in `public/` directory
2. Check `next.config.js` has correct remote patterns
3. Ensure images are committed to Git

## Rollback

If you need to rollback to a previous deployment:

1. Go to Vercel dashboard â†’ Deployments
2. Find the working deployment
3. Click "..." â†’ "Promote to Production"

## Environment-Specific Deployments

### Preview Deployments

- Automatically created for pull requests
- Use different environment variables if needed
- Test before merging to main

### Production

- Triggered by pushes to `main` branch
- Uses production environment variables
- Can be manually triggered in dashboard

## Performance Optimization

After deployment:

1. Enable Vercel Speed Insights
2. Monitor Core Web Vitals
3. Optimize images if needed
4. Enable ISR for dynamic pages if applicable

## Security

- Never commit `.env.local` file
- Use Vercel environment variables for secrets
- Keep dependencies updated
- Enable Vercel firewall rules if needed

## Support

If you encounter issues:

1. Check Vercel documentation: https://vercel.com/docs
2. Review Next.js deployment guide: https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment
3. Check Vercel community: https://github.com/vercel/vercel/discussions

## Next Steps After Deployment

1. Implement remaining pages:
   - Guest upload page (`/e/[slug]`)
   - Full dashboard page with gallery
2. Add proper error boundaries
3. Implement proper loading states
4. Add analytics tracking
5. Set up monitoring and alerts
